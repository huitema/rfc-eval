--- abstract

This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently published RFC.
We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in 2018, looking for history
and delays. The average RFC was produced in 3 years and 4 months,
of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group,
3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC
production. The main variation in RFC production delays comes from
the AUTH48 phase.

We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic
Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment.
We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but
correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications.

The measurement of delays could be automated by processing dates and
events recorded in the data tracker. The measurement of published
RFC could be complemented by statistics on abandoned drafts, which
would measure the efficiency of the IETF triaging process.

# RFC Evaluation project

As stated on the organization's web site, "The IETF is a large open international
community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with
the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet."
In this memo, we attempt to evaluate the RFC production process.

The IETF data tracker provides information about RFC and drafts, from which we can
infer statistics about the production system. We can measure how
long it takes to drive a proposition from initial draft to final publication,
and how these delays can be split between Working Group discussions, IETF reviews,
IESG assessment, RFC Editor delays and final reviews by the authors.

Just measuring production delays may be misleading. If the IETF simply rubber-stamped
draft proposals and published them, the delays would be short but the quality and
impact might suffer. We hope that most of the RFC that are published are useful,
but we need a way to measure that usefulness. We try to do that by measuring the
number of references of the published RFCs in Semantic Scholar, and also by checking
whether the protocols and technologies defined in the RFCs were implemented and used on
the Internet.

In order to limit the resource required for this study, we selected at random 20
RFC published in 2018, as explained in (#sample-selection). For comparison purposes,
we also selected at random 20 RFC published in 1998 and 20 published in 2008.
The information gathered for every RFC in the sample is presented in
(#sample-rfc-analysis). In (#process-analysis) we analyze the production process
and the sources of delays, comparing the 2018 sample to the selected samples for 1998
and 2018. In (#citation-numbers) we present citation counts for the RFC in the samples,
and analyze whether citation counts could be used to evaluate the quality of RFC.
Finally, we present the conclusion of the study and propose next steps in
(#conclusion).


# Selecting a random sample of RFC {#sample-selection}

Basic production mechanisms could be evaluated by processing data from
the IETF tracker, but subjective data requires manual assessment of results,
which can be time consuming. Since our resources are limited, we will only
perform this analysis for a small sample of RFC, selected at random
from the list of RFC approved in 2018. Specifically, we will pick
20 RFC at random between:

* RFC 8307, published in January 2018, and

* RFC 8511, published December 2018.

In order to avoid injecting personal bias in the random selection, we use
a random selection process similar to the Nomination Committee selection
process defined in {{?RFC3797}}. The process is seeded with the text string
"vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas", and the results are:

When evaluating delays and impact, we will compare the year 2018 to 2008 and
1998, 10 and 20 years ago. To drive this comparison, we pick 20 RFC at random
among those published in 2008, and another 20 among those published in 1998.
We use the same nomcom-like methodology.

For 2008, we picking random RFC numbers between RFC 5134
(January 2008) and RFC 5405 (December 2008), using the sentence "sed fugit interea
fugit irreparabile tempus" as a seed. We actually list here 21 numbers, because
the random draw place RFC 5315 in 20th position, but that RFC was never issued.
We replace it by RFC 5301, which came in 21st position.

# Analysis of 20 selected RFC {#sample-rfc-analysis}

We review each of the RFC listed in (#methodology) for the year 2018, trying 
both to answer the known questions and to gather insight for further analyzes.
In many cases, the analysis of the data is complemented by direct feedback
from the RFC authors.

The draft underwent minor copy edit before publication. 

The long delay in Auth48 is probaby due to clustering with {{?RFC8410}}, which entered
AUTH 48 on 06/05. The MISSREF tracker code was cleared then.

The draft underwent very extensive copy editing, covering use of articles, turn of phrases, choice
of vocabulary. The changes are enough to cause pagination differences. The "diff" tool marks pretty
much every page as changed. Some diagrams see change in protocol elements like message names.

According to the author, the experience of producing this draft mirrors a typical one in the
Benchmarking Methodologies Working Group (BMWG).There were multiple authors in multiple time
zones, which slowed down the AUTH process somewhat, although the Auth48 delay of 46 is only
a bit longer than the average draft.

The RFC was part of cluster with {{?RFC8455}}.

BMWG publishes informational RFCs centered around benchmarking,
and the methodologies in RFC 8456 have been implemented in benchmarking products.

## 8446
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 {{?RFC8446}}, as the title
indicates, defines the new version of the TLS protocol. From the datatracker, we extract
the following:

The RFC was a major effort in the IETF. Working group members developed and tested
several implementations. Researchers analyzed the specifications and performed 
formal verifications. Deployment tests outlined issues that caused extra work
when the specification was almost ready. These complexity largely explains the
time spent in the working group.

Comparing the final draft to the published version, we find relatively light copy
editing. It includes explaining acronyms on first use, clarifying some definitions 
standardizing punctiation and capitalization, and spelling out some numbers in text.
This generally fall in the category of "style", although some of the clarifications
go into message definitions. However, that simple analysis does not explain why
the Auth48 phase took almost two months.

This document's Auth48 process was part of the "Github experiment", which tried to
use github pull requests to track the AUTH48 changes and review comments. The
RPC staff had to learn using Github for that process, and this required more work
than the usual RFC. Author and AD thoroughly reviewed each proposed 
edit, accepting some and rejecting some. The concern there was that
any change in a complex specification might affect a protocol that was extensively
reviewed in the working group, but of course these reviews added time to the
Aouth48 delays. 

There are 21 implementations listed
in the Wiki of the TLS 1.3 project. It has been deployed on major browsers, and
is already used in a large fraction of TLS connections.

## 8355
Resiliency Use Cases in Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) Networks {{?RFC8355}} is an informational RFC.
It originated from a use case informational draft that was mostly used for the BOF creating the WG, and then to
drive initial work/evolutions from the WG.

Minor set of copy edit, mostly for style.

No implementation of the RFC itself, but the technology behind it such as
Segment Routing (architecture RFC 8402, TI-LFA draft-ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa) is widely implemented
and deployment is ongoing.

According to participants in the discussion, the process of adoption of the source packet routing
standards was very contentious. The establishment of consensus at both the working group level
and the IETF level was difficult and time consuming.

This RFC defines the support of WebSockets in HTTP/2, which is different
from the mechanism defined for HTTP/1.1 in {{?RFC6455}}. The process was
relatively straightforward, involving the usual type of discussions, some
on details and some on important points.

Comparing final draft and published RFC shows a minor set of copy edit,
mostly for style. However, the author recalls a painful process. The RFC
includes many charts and graphs that were very difficult to format
correctly in the author's production process that involve conversions
from markdown to XML, and then from XML to text. The author had to
get substantial help from the RFC editor.

There are several implementations, including Firefox and Chrome,
making RFC 8441 a very successful standard.

~~~

This RFC took only 9 months from first draft to publication, which is the shortest in
the 2018 sample set. In part, this is because the text was privately circulated
and reviewed before the first draft was published. The nature of the document is
another reason for the short delay. It is an opinion piece, and does not require
the same type of consensus building and reviews than a protocol specification.

Comparing the final draft and the published version shows only minor copy edit, mostly
for style. According to the author, because this is because he knows how to write in RFC
Style with the result that his documents often need a minimum of editing. He also
makes sure that the document on which the
Production Center starts working already has changes discussed
and approved during Last Call and IESG review incorporated
rather than expecting the Production Center to operate off of
notes about changed to be made.

The goal of the draft was to document what the
gnutls implementation was using for storing provably generated RSA keys.
This is a short RFC that was published relatively quickly, although
discussion between the author, the Independent Series Editor and the
IESG lasted several months. In the initial conflict review, Tthe IESG asked
the ISE to not publish this document before IETF working groups had
an opportunity to pick up the work. The author met that requirement by
a presentation to the SECDISPATCH WG in IETF 102. Since no WG was
interested in pickup the work, the document progressed on the
Independent Stream.

Very minor set of copy edit, moving some references from normative to informative.

The author is not aware of other implementations than gnutls relying on this RFC.

This RFC recommends to deprecate two encryption algorithms that are now considered
obsolete and possibly broken. The document was sent back to the WG after the first last call,
edited, and then there was a second last call. The delay from first draft to working group
last call was relatively short, but the number may be misleading. The initial draft was a
replacement of a similar draft in the KITTEN working group, which stagnated for some time
before the CURDLE working group took up the work. 
The deprecation of RC4 was somewhat contentious, but the WG had already debated this
prior to the production of this draft, and the draft was not delayed by this debate.

Most of the 280 days between IETF LC and IESG approval was
because the IESG had to talk about whether this document should obsolete or
move to historic RFC 4757, and no one was really actively pushing that
discussion for a while.

The 99 days in AUTH48 are mostly because one of the authors was a sitting AD, and those
duties ended up taking precedence over reviewing this document.

Minor copy editing, for style.

The implementation of the draft would be the actual removal of support for 3DES and RC4
in major implementations. This is happening, but very slowly.

The TCP congestion control algorithm Cubic was defined first in 2005, was implemented
in Linux soon after, and was implemented in major OSes after that. After some debates
from 2015 to 2015, the TCPM working group adopted the draft, with a goal of
documenting Cubic in the RFc series. According to the authors, this was not
a high priority effort, as Cubic was already implemented in multiple OSes
and documented in research papers. At some point, only one of the authors
was actively working on the draft. Ths may explain why another two years was spent
progressing the draft after adoption by the WG.

The RFC publication may or may not have triggered further implementations. On
the other hand, several OSes picked up bug fixes from the draft and the RFC.

This RFC has a complex history. The first individual draft was submitted to the
TLS working group on September 7, 2012. It progressed there, and was adopted
by the WG after 3 revisions. There were then 8 revisions in the TLS WG,
until the WG decided to not progress it. The draft was parked in 2013 by
the WG chairs after failing to get consensus in WG last call. The AD finally
pulled the plug in 2016, and the draft was then resubmitted to the ISE.

At that point, the author was busy and was treating this RFC with a 
low priority because, in his words, it would not be a "real RFC".
There were problems with the draft that only came up late. In particular,
it had to wait for a change in registry policy that only came about with
the publication of TLS 1.3, which caused the draft to only be published
after RFC 8446, and also required adding references to TLS 1.3.
The author also got a very late comment while in AUTH48 that 
caused some rewrite. Finally, there was some IANA issue with the extension
registry where a similar extension was added by someone else. The draft
was changed to just use it. 

Changes in AUTH48 include added reference to TLS 1.3, copy-editing for style,
some added requirements, added paragraphs, and changes in algorithms specification.

Preparing the RFC took more than 4 years. According to the authors, they were
not aggressive pushing it and just let the working group process decide to pace
it. They also did implementations during that time.

Minor copy editing, for style.

The RFC was implemented by lispers.net and cisco,
and was used in doing IPv6 multicast over IPv4 unicast/multicast at the Olympics
in PyeungChang. The plan is to work on a proposedstandard once the
experiment concludes.

This is a pretty simple document, but it took over 3 years from individual draft to RFC. According to
the authors,the biggest setbacks occurred at the start: it took a while to find a home for this draft.
It was presented in the TLS WG (because it's a TLS extension) and UTA WG (because it has to do with
applications using TLS). Then the ADs determined that a new WG was needed, so the authors had to work
through the WG creation process, including running a BOF.

Minor copy editing, for style, with the addition of a reference to TLS 1.3.

Perhaps partially due to the delays, some of the implementers lost interest in supporting this RFC.

The specification was first submitted as a personal draft in the IPv6 WG, then moved to the OSPF WG.
The long delay of producing this RFC is due to the complexity of the problem,
and the need to wait for implementations. It is a very important change to OSPF
that makes OSPFv3 fully extensible. Since it was a non-backward compatible change,
the developers started out with some very complex migration scenarios but ended up
with either legacy or extended OSPFv3 LSAs within an OSPFv3 routing domain. The initial attempts
to have a hybrid mode of operation with both legacy and extended LSAs also delayed implementation
due to the complexity.

Copy editing for style and clarity.

This specification either was or will be implemented by all the router vendors.

RFC8468 was somehow special in that
there was not a technical reason/interest that triggered it, but
rather a formal requirement.
While writing RFC7312 the IP Performance
Metrics working group (IPPM) realized that RFC 2330, the IP Performance
Metrics Framework supported IPv4 only
and explicitly excluded support for IPv6. Nevertheless, people used
the metrics that were defined on top of RFC 2330 (and, therefore, IPv4
only) for IPv6, too. Although the IPPM WG agreed that the work was needed, the
interest of IPPM attendees in progressing (and reading/reviewing) the
IPv6 draft was limited. Resolving the IPv6 technical part was
straight-forward, but subsequently some people asked for a broader scope
(topics like header compression, 6lo, etc.) and it took some time to
figure out and later on convince people that these topics are out of scope.
The group also had to resolve contentious topics, for example how to
measure the processing of IPv6 extension headers, which is sometimes non-standard.

The Auth48 delay for this draft was longer than average. According to the authors,
the main reasons include:

- Work-load and travel caused by busy-work-periods of all co-authors

- Time zone difference between co-authors and editor (at least US,
Europe, India, not considering travel)

- Editor proposing and committing some unacceptable modifications that
needed to be reverted

- Lengthy discussions on a new document title (required high effort and
took a long time, in particular reaching consensus between co-authors
and editor was time-consuming and involved the AD)

- Editor correctly identifying some nits (obsoleted personal websites of
co-authors) and co-authors attempting to fix them.

The differences between the final draft and the publish RFC show copy editing for style
and clarity, but do not account for the back and forth between authors and editors
mentioned by the authors.

# Analysis of process and delays {#process-analysis}

We examine the 20 RFC in the sample, measuring various characteristics such
as delay and citation counts, in an attempt to identify patterns in the
IETF processes.

## Publication delays

We look at the distribution of delays between the submission of the first
draft and the publication of the RFC. We break out the total delay in three
components:

* The working group delay, from the first draft to the start of the IETF
  last call;

* The IETF delay, which lasts from the beginning of the IETF last call to
  the approval by the IESG, including the reviews by
  various directorates;

* The RFC production, from approval by the IESG to publication, including
  the Auth48 reviews.

For submissions to the independent stream, we don't have a working group.
We consider instead the progression of the individual draft until the
adoption by the ISE as the equivalent of the "working group" period, 
and the delay from adoption by the ISE until submission to the RFC Editor
as the equivalent of the IETF delay. The following table
shows the delays for the 20 RFC in the sample:

| RFC | Status | Pages | Overall | WG | IETF | Edit |

The average delay from first draft to publication is about 3 years, but this
varies widely. Excluding the independent stream submissions, the average
delay from start to finish is 3 years and 4 months, of which on average
2 years and 10 months are spent getting consensus in the working group,
and 3 to 4 months each for IETF consensus and for RFC production.

The longest delay is found for {{?RFC8492}}, 6.5 years from start to finish.
This is however a very special case, a draft that was prepared for
the TLS working group and failed to reach consensus. After that, it was
resubmitted to the ISE, and incurred atypical production delays.

On average, we see that 80% of the delay is incurred in WG processing,
10% in IETF review, and 10% for edition and publication.
We can compare these delays to those observed 10 years ago and 20 years
ago:

We can compare the median delay, and the delays observed by the fastest and
slowest quartiles in the three years:

Year | Fastest 25% | Median | Slowest 25%
---- | ----:| ----:|----:
2018 | 604 | 1179 | 1522
2008 | 869 | 1081 | 1675
1998 | 169 | 365 | 442

The IETF takes three to four times more times to produce an RFC in 2018
than it did in 1998, but about the same time as it did in 2008. 

The increased delay does not mean increased work per RFC. 
The number of RFC published per year remained between 200 and
300 all those years, and the number of participants is not greater now
than in 1998. If we estimated the "level of attention" by dividing the
number of participants by the number of RFC produced, we would see
a number that remains stable. People are probably not working much
more on each RFC now than they were 20 years ago, but the same amount
of work is stretched over a much longer period.


## Preparation and Publication delays

The preparation and publication delays include three components: 

* the delay from submission to the RFC Editor to beginning of Auth48, during 
  which the document is prepared;

* the AUTH48 delay, during which authors review and eventually approve the
  changes proposed by the editors;

* the publication delay, from final agreement by authors and editors to
  actual publication.

The breakdown of the publication delays for each RFC is shown in the
following table.

| RFC | Status | Pages | RFC edit | Auth 48 | RFC Pub | Edit(total) |
| ---:| ----- | -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| 8411 | Info | 5 | 53 | 88 | 20 | 161 |

|  | Average |  | 77.3 | 41.2 | 4.2 | 122.7 |
|-8492  | Average |  | 62 | 37 | 4 | 103 |

On average, the total delay appears to be a bit more than four month, but the
average is skewed by the extreme values encountered for {{?RFC8492}}. If we
exclude that RFC from the computations, the average delay drops to a just a bit
more than 3 months: about 2 months for the preparation, a bit more than one
month for the Auth48 phase, and 4 days for the publishing. 

Of course, these delays vary from RFC to RFC. To try explain the causes of the
delay, we compute the correlation factor between the observed delays and 4
plausible explanation factors:

* The number of pages in the document,
* The amount of copy edit, as discussed in (#copy-editing),
* Whether or not an IANA action was required.

We find the following values:

| Correlation | RFC edit | Auth 48 | Edit(total) |
| ----- | -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| Nb pages | 0.50 | -0.04 | 0.21 |
| Copy-Edit | 0.42 | 0.24 | 0.45 |
| IANA | -0.13 | 0.26 | 0.15 |

None of these indicate strong correlations. The greater number of pages will
tend to increase the preparation delay, but it does not appear to impact the
Auth48 delay at all. The amount of copy editing also tend to increase the
the preparation delay somewhat and the Auth48 delay a little. The presence or
absence of IANA action has very ittle correlation with the delays.

We also observe that the Auth48 delay varies much more than the preparation
delay, with a standard deviation of 20 days for Auth48 versus 10 days for
the preparation delay. In theory, Auth48 is just a final
verification: the authors receive the document prepared by the RFC production center,
and just have to give their approval, or maybe request a last minute
correction. The name indicates that this is expected to last just two days, but
in average it lasts more than a month.

We tested a variety of hypotheses that might explain the duration of AUTH48
by computing the correlation coefficients between various properties of the RFC
and the production delays. The results are listed in the following table:

Correlation | RFC production | Auth 48 | RFC Edit(total)
 :----- | ----:| ----:| ----:
Nb drafts | 0.19 | -0.30 | -0.17
Nb Authors | 0.40 | -0.04 | 0.16
WG delay | 0.03 | -0.16 | -0.15

The results show that there is no simple answer. The number of pages, the
required amount of copy editing and to a very small extent the number of drafts
can help predict the production delay, but there is no obvious predictor for
the Auth 48 delay. In particular, there is no numerical evidence that the
number of authors influences the Auth48 delay, or that authors who have spent
a long time working on the document in the working group somehow spend
even longer to answer questions during Auth48 -- if anything, the numerical
results point in the opposite direction.

After asking the authors of the RFC in the sample why the AUTH48 phase took
a long time, and we got three explanations:

1- Some RFC have multiple authors in multiple time zones. This slows down
   the coordination required for approving changes.

2- Some authors found some of the proposed changes unnecessary or
   undesirable, and asked that they be reversed. This required long
   exchanges between authors and editors.

3- Some authors were not giving high priority to AUTH48 responses.

As mentioned above, we were not able to verify these hypotheses by looking at
the data.

## Copy editing

We can assess the amount of copy editing applied to each published RFC by
comparing the text of the draft approved for publication and the text of the
RFC. We do expect differences in the "boilerplate" and in the IANA section,
but we will also see differences due to copy editing. Assessing the amount
of copy editing is subjective, and we do it using a scale of 1 to 4:

1- Minor editing

2- Editing for style, such as capitalization, hyphens, that versus which,
   and expending all acronyms at least one.

3- Editing for clarity in addition to style, such as rewriting ambiguous
   sentences and clarifying use of internal references. For Yang models,
   that may include model corrections suggested by the verifier.

4- Extensive editing.

The following table shows that with about half of the RFC required
editing for style, and the other half at least some editing for clarity.

| RFC | Status | Copy Edit |
| ---:| ----- | -----:|
| 8411 | Info | 2 |
| 8456 | Info | 4 |
| 8446 | PS | 3 |
| 8355 | Info | 2 |
| 8441 | PS | 2 |
| 8324 | ISE | 2 |
| 8377 | PS | 3 |

| 8472 | PS | 2 |
| 8466 | PS | 3 |
| 8362 | PS | 3 |
| 8468 | Info | 3 |

This method of assessment does not take into account
the number of changes proposed by the editors and eventually rejected
by the authors, since these changes are not present in either the
final draft or the published RFC. It might be possible to get
an evaluation of these "phantom changes" from the RFC Production Center.

## Independent Series

Out of 20 randomly selected RFC, 3 were published through the "independent series".
One is an independent opinion, another a description of a non-IETF protocol
format, and the third was {{?RFC8492}}, which is a special case. Apart from
this special case, the publication delays were significantly shorter 
for the Independent Stream than for the IETF stream.
This seems to indicate that the Independent Series is functioning as 
expected.

The authors of these 3 RFC are regular IETF contributors. This
observation motivated a secondary analysis of all the RFC
published in the "independent" stream in 2018. There are 14 such RFC:
8507, 8494, 8493, 8492, 8483, 8479, 8433, 8409, 8374, 8369, 8367, 8351,
8328 and 8324. (RFC 8367 and 8369 were
published on 1 April 2018.) We can ask whether the authors of
these RFC are these outsiders, part of a "wider community" or are
people who are also contributing to the IETF. The overwhelming
response is, "insiders". Pretty much all the authors are or were
involved in the IETF, many of them with a prominent track record. There
are just 2 exceptions, a single RFC in which only 3 of the 5 authors are
well associated with the IETF.

# Citation Counts {#citations}

In this exploration, we want to assess whether citation counts provide a
meaningful assessment of the popularity of RFC. We obtain the citation
counts through the Semantic Scholar API, using queries of the form:
~~~
http://api.semanticscholar.org/
     v1/paper/10.17487/rfc8446?include_unknown_references=true
~~~
In these queries, the RFC is uniquely identified by its DOI reference,
which is composed of the RFC Series prefix 10.17487 and the rfc identifier.
The queries return a series of properties, including a list of citations
for the RFC. Based on that list of citations, we compute three numbers:

* The total number of citations
* The number of citations in the year of publication and the year after
  that
* For the RFC published in 1998 or 2008 that we use for comparison, the
  number of citations in the years 2018 and 2019.

All the numbers were retrieved on October 6, 2019.

## Citation Numbers {#citation-numbers}

As measured on October 6, 2019, the citation counts for the RFC in
our sample set were:

RFC(2018) | Status | Total | 2018-2019
---- | ---- | ----:| ----:
8411|Info|1|0
8456|Info|1|1
8446|PS|418|204
8355|Info|3|3
8441|PS|1|1|
8324|ISE|0|0
8377|PS|0|0
8498|Info|0|0
8479|ISE|0|0
8453|Info|3|3
8429|BCP|0|0
8312|Info|25|16
8492|ISE|4|4
8378|Exp|1|1
8361|PS|0|0
8472|PS|1|1
8466|PS|0|0
8362|PS|1|1
8468|Info|1|1

The results indicate that {{?RFC8446}} is by far the most cited of the 20
RFC in our sample. This is not surprising, since TLS is a key Internet Protocol.
The TLS 1.3 protocol was also the subject of extensive studies by researchers,
and thus was mentioned in a number of published papers. 
Surprisingly, the Semantic Scholar mentions a number of citations that predate
the publication date. These are probably citations of the various draft
versions of the protocol.

The next most cited RFC in the sample is {{?RFC8312}} which describes the
Cubic congestion control algorithm for TCP. That protocol was also the
target of a large number of academic publications.The other RFC in the
sample only have a small number of citations.

## Comparison to 1998 and 2008

In order to get a baseline, we can look at the number of references for the
RFC published in 2008 and 1998. However, we need totake time into account.
Documents published a long time ago are expected to have accrued more references.
We try to address this by looking at three counts for each document: the
overall number of references over the document's lifetime, the number of
references obtained in the year following publication, and the number of
references observed since 2018: 


RFC(2008) | Status | Total | 2008-2009 | 2018-2019
---- | ---- | ----:| ----:| ----:
5326|Exp|138|14|15
5348|PS|14|3|0
5281|Info|69|15|7
5354|Exp|17|13|0
5227|PS|19|1|2
5329|PS|24|6|1
5277|PS|32|3|2
5236|ISE|25|5|4
5358|BCP|21|2|0

We can compare the median number of citations and the numbers of citations
for the least and most popular quartiles in the three years:

References | Lower 25% | Median | Higher 25%
------ | ----:|----:|----:
RFC (2018) | 0 | 1 | 3
RFC (2008) | 6.5 | 11 | 21.75
RFC (2008), until 2009 | 1 | 2.5 | 4.5
RFC (2008), 2018 and after | 0 | 0 | 2
RFC (1998) | 4.75 | 13.5 | 32.25
RFC (1998), until 1999 | 0 | 2 | 4.25
RFC (1998), 2018 and after | 0 | 0 | 1

The total numbers shows new documents with fewer citations than the older ones.
This can be explained to some degree by the passage of time. If we
restrict the analysis to the number of citations accrued in the year of
publishing and the year after that, we still see about the same distribution
for the three samples.

We also see that the number of references to RFC fades over time. Only the
most popular of the RFC produced in 1998 are still cited in 2019.

## Citations versus deployments

The following table shows
side by side the number of citations as measured in (#citation-numbers) and
the estimation of deployment as indicated in (#sample-rfc-analysis). 

RFC(2018) | Status | Citations | Deployment
---- | ---- | ----:| ----:
8411|Info|1|medium
8456|Info|1|medium
8446|PS|418|high
8355|Info|3|medium
8441|PS|1|high
8324|ISE|0|N/A
8377|PS|0| unknown
8498|Info|0|unknown
8479|ISE|0|one
8453|Info|3|unknown
8429|BCP|0|some
8312|Info|25|high
8492|ISE|4| one
8378|Exp|1|some
8361|PS|0|one
8472|PS|1|medium
8466|PS|0|unknown
8362|PS|1|medium
8468|Info|1|some

From looking at these results, it is fairly obvious that citation counts
cannot be used as proxies for the "value" of an RFC. In our sample, the two
RFC that have high citation counts were both widely deployed, and can certainly be 
described as successful, but we also see many RFC that saw significant deployment
without garnering a high level of citations.

Citation counts are driven by academic interest,
but are only loosely correlated with actual deployment. We saw that {{?RFC8446}}
was widely cited in part because the standardization process involved many
researchers, and that the high citation count of {{?RFC8312}} is
largely due to the academic interest in evaluating congestion control protocols.
If we look at previous years, the most cited RFC in the 2008 sample is {{?RFC5326}}, an
experimental RFC defining security extensions to an
experimental delay tolerant transport protocol. This protocol does not
carry a significant proportion of Internet traffic, but has been the object
of a fair number of academic studies.

The citation process tends to privilege the first expression of a concept.
We see that with the most cited RFC in the 1998 set is {{?RFC2267}}, an informational
RFC defining Network Ingress Filtering that was obsoleted in May
2000 by {{?RFC2827}}. It is still cited frequently in 2018 and
2019, regardless of its formal status in
the RFC series. We see the same effect at work with {{?RFC8441}}, which
garners very few citations although it obsoletes {{?RFC6455}} that has
a large number of citations. The same goes for {{?RFC8468}}, which is
sparsely cited while the {{?RFC2330}} is widely cited. Just counting citations
will not indicate whether developers still use an old specification or
have adopted the revised RFC.

# Observations and Next Steps {#conclusion}

The goal of this study was to evaluate how the IETF produces standards,
from working group processing to RFC production. As shown in
(#process-analysis), the average RFC was produced in 3 years and 4 months, 
which is similar to what was found in the
2008 sample, but more than three times larger than the delays for the
1998 sample.

The Working group process appears to be the main source of delays. Efforts
to diminish delays should probably focus there, instead of on the
IETF and IESG reviews of the RFC production. For the RFC production
phase, most of the variability originates in the AUTH48 process,
which is influenced by a variety of factors such as number of
authors or level of engagement of these authors.

The Independent Submission stream operates as expected. The authors of
the independent RFC appear to be mostly IETF insiders.

The analysis of citations in (#citation-numbers) shows that citation
numbers are a very poor indication of the "value" of an RFC. Citation
numbers measure the engagement of academic researchers with specific
topics, but have little correlation with the level of adoption and
deployment of a specific RFC.

This document analyses a small sample of RFC "in depth". This allowed
gathering of detailed feedback on the process and the deployments. On
the other hand, much of the data on delays is available from the
data tracker. It may be worth considering adding an automated
reporting of delay metrics in the data tracker.

This document only considers the RFC that were published in a given
year. This approach can be criticized as introducing a form of
"survivor bias". There are many drafts proposed to the IETF, and only
a fraction of them end up being published as RFC. 
On one hand this is expected,
because part of the process is to triage between ideas that can gather
consensus and those that don't. On the other hand, we don't know
whether that triage is too drastic and discouraged progress on good
ideas.

One way to evaluate the triage process would be to 
look at publication attempts that were abandoned, for
example drafts that expired without progressing or being replaced. The sampling
methodology could also be used for that purpose. Pick maybe 20 drafts at random,
among those abandoned in a target year, and investigate why they were abandoned.
Was it because better solutions emerged in the working group? Or maybe because
the authors discovered a flaw in their proposal? Or was it because some factional
struggle blocked a good idea? Was the idea pursued in a different venue?
Hopefully, someone will try this kind of investigation.

# Security considerations

This draft does not specify any protocol.

We might want to analyze whether security issues were discovered after
publication of specific standards.

# IANA Considerations

This draft does not require any IANA action.

Peliminary analysis does not indicate that IANA is causing any particular
delay in the RFC publication process.
