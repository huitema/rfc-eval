                   draft-huitema-rfc-eval-project-01

Abstract

   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently
   published RFC.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in
   2018, looking for history and delays, and using Google Scholar as a
   proxy for the RFC popularity.  The results are interesting, and
   inform further evaluation efforts.

1.  RFC Evaluation project

   As stated on the organization's web site, "The IETF is a large open
   international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and
   researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture
   and the smooth operation of the Internet."  In this memo, we attempt
   to evaluate the RFC production process.

   The IETF data tracker provides information about RFC and drafts, from
   which we can infer statistics about the production system.  We can
   measure how long it takes to drive a proposition from initial draft

   to final publication, and how these delays can be split between
   Working Group discussions, IETF reviews, IESG assessment, RFC Editor
   delays and final reviews by the authors.

   Just measuring production delays may be misleading.  If the IETF
   simply rubber-stamped draft proposals and published them, the delays
   would be short but the quality and impact might suffer.  We hope that
   most of the RFC that are published are useful, but we need a way to
   measure that usefulness.  We try to do that by measuring the number
   of references of the published RFCs in Google Scholar, and also by
   checking whether the protocols and technologies defined in the RFCs
   were implemented and used on the Internet.

2.  Methodology

   In this exploration, we want to evaluate not just the mechanics of
   the RFC production, but also the quality and impact of the results.
   This evaluation of quality and impact is subjective.  We start with
   two ideas:

   1- Use Google Scholar to assess the citation counts of published
   documents

   2- Ask the RFC authors whether the specifications resulted in the
   deployment of products or services

   When accessing Google Scholar, we search for quoted strings of the
   form "RFC xxxx".  This is an arbitrary choice, we could for example
   have chosen to search for "RFCxxx" or a combination of the two forms.
   We retained the simpler alternative, because we don't believe that
   picking one or the other would introduce a significant bias.

   Basic production mechanisms could be evaluated by processing data
   from the IETF tracker, but subjective data requires manual assessment
   of results, which can be time consuming.  Google Scholar also
   requires manual access because the site does not offer an open API.
   Since our resources are limited, we will only perform this analysis
   for a small sample of RFC, selected at random from the list of RFC
   approved in 2018.  Specifically, we will pick 20 RFC at random
   between:

   o  RFC 8307, published in January 2018, and

   o  RFC 8511, published December 2018.

   In order to avoid injecting personal bias in the random selecton, we
   use a random selection process similar to the Nomination Committee
   selection process defined in [RFC3797].  The process is seeded with

   When evaluating delays and impact, we will compare the year 2018 to
   2008 and 1998, 10 and 20 years ago.  To drive this comparison, we
   pick 20 RFC at random among those published in 2008, and another 20
   among those published in 1998.  We use the same nomcom-like
   methodology.

   For 2008, we picking random RFC numbers between RFC 5134 (January
   2008) and RFC 5405 (December 2008), using the sentence "sed fugit
   interea fugit irreparabile tempus" as a seed.  We actually list here
   21 numbers, because the random draw place RFC 5315 in 20th position,
   but that RFC was never issued.  We replace it by RFC 5301, which came
   in 21st position.

3.  Analysis of 20 selected RFC

   We review each of the RFC listed in (#methodology) for the year 2018,
   trying both to answer the known questions and to gather insight for
   further analyzes.  In many cases, the analysis of the data is
   complemented by direct feedback from the RFC authors.

   The long delay in Auth48 is probaby due to clustering with [RFC8410],
   which entered AUTH 48 on 06/05.  The MISSREF tracker code was cleared
   then.

3.2.  8456

   Benchmarking Methodology for Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

   The draft underwent very extensive copy editing, covering use of
   articles, turn of phrases, choice of vocabulary.  The changes are
   enough to cause pagination differences.  The "diff" tool marks pretty
   much every page as changed.  Some diagrams see change in protocol
   elements like message names.

   According to the author, the experience of producing this draft
   mirrors a typical one in the Benchmarking Methodologies Working Group
   (BMWG).There were multiple authors in multiple time zones, which
   slowed down the AUTH process somewhat, although the Auth48 delay of
   46 is only a bit longer than the average draft.

   The RFC was part of cluster with [RFC8455].

   Google Scholar shows 3 references.  BMWG publishes informational RFCs
   centered around benchmarking, and the methodologies in RFC 8456 have
   been implemented in benchmarking products.

3.3.  8446

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3 [RFC8446], as
   the title indicates, defines the new version of the TLS protocol.

   The RFC was a major effort in the IETF.  Working group members
   developed and tested several implementations.  Researchers analyzed
   the specifications and performed formal verifications.  Deployment
   tests outlined issues that caused extra work when the specification
   was almost ready.  These complexity largely explains the time spent
   in the working group.

   Comparing the final draft to the published version, we find
   relatively light copy editing.  It includes explaining acronyms on
   first use, clarifying some definitions standardizing punctiation and
   capitalization, and spelling out some numbers in text.  This
   generally fall in the category of "style", although some of the
   clarifications go into message definitions.  However, that simple
   analysis does not explain why the Auth48 phase took almost two
   months.

   This document's Auth48 process was part of the "Github experiment",
   which tried to use github pull requests to track the AUTH48 changes
   and review comments.  The RPC staff had to learn using Github for
   that process, and this required more work than the usual RFC.  Author
   and AD thoroughly reviewed each proposed edit, accepting some and
   rejecting some.  The concern there was that any change in a complex
   specification might affect a protocol that was extensively reviewed
   in the working group, but of course these reviews added time to the
   Aouth48 delays.

   The RFC has 123 references in Google Scholar.  There are 21
   implementations listed in the Wiki of the TLS 1.3 project.  It has
   been deployed on major browsers, and is already used in a large
   fraction of TLS connections.

   case informational draft that was mostly used for the BOF creating
   the WG, and then to drive initial work/evolutions from the WG.

   This RFC defines the support of WebSockets in HTTP/2, which is
   different from the mechanism defined for HTTP/1.1 in [RFC6455].  The
   process was relatively straightforward, involving the usual type of
   discussions, some on details and some on important points.

   Comparing final draft and published RFC shows a minor set of copy
   edit, mostly for style.  However, the author recalls a painful
   process.  The RFC includes many charts and graphs that were very
   difficult to format correctly in the author's production process that
   involve conversions from markdown to XML, and then from XML to text.
   The author had to get substantial help from the RFC editor.

   No references on Google Scholar.  (RFC 6455 had over 1000 results)

   There are several implementations, including Firefox and Chrome,
   making RFC 8441 a very successful standard.

   This RFC took only 9 months from first draft to publication, which is
   the shortest in the 2018 sample set.  In part, this is because the
   text was privately circulated and reviewed before the first draft was
   published.  The nature of the document is another reason for the
   short delay.  It is an opinion piece, and does not require the same
   type of consensus building and reviews than a protocol specification.

   Comparing the final draft and the published version shows only minor
   copy edit, mostly for style.  According to the author, because this
   is because he knows how to write in RFC Style with the result that
   his documents often need a minimum of editing.  He also makes sure
   that the document on which the Production Center starts working
   already has changes discussed and approved during Last Call and IESG
   review incorporated rather than expecting the Production Center to
   operate off of notes about changed to be made.

   RFC that was published relatively quickly, although discussion
   between the author, the Independent Series Editor and the IESG lasted
   several months.  In the initial conflict review, Tthe IESG asked the
   ISE to not publish this document before IETF working groups had an
   opportunity to pick up the work.  The author met that requirement by
   a presentation to the SECDISPATCH WG in IETF 102.  Since no WG was
   interested in pickup the work, the document progressed on the

   working group, which stagnated for some time before the CURDLE
   working group took up the work.  The deprecation of RC4 was somewhat
   contentious, but the WG had already debated this prior to the
   production of this draft, and the draft was not delayed by this
   debate.

   Most of the 280 days between IETF LC and IESG approval was because
   the IESG had to talk about whether this document should obsolete or
   move to historic RFC 4757, and no one was really actively pushing
   that discussion for a while.

   The 99 days in AUTH48 are mostly because one of the authors was a
   sitting AD, and those duties ended up taking precedence over
   reviewing this document.

   priority effort, as Cubic was already implemented in multiple OSes

   another two years was spent progressing the draft after adoption by

   This RFC has a complex history.  The first individual draft was
   submitted to the TLS working group on September 7, 2012.  It
   progressed there, and was adopted by the WG after 3 revisions.  There
   were then 8 revisions in the TLS WG, until the WG decided to not
   progress it.  The draft was parked in 2013 by the WG chairs after
   failing to get consensus in WG last call.  The AD finally pulled the
   plug in 2016, and the draft was then resubmitted to the ISE.

   At that point, the author was busy and was treating this RFC with a
   low priority because, in his words, it would not be a "real RFC".
   There were problems with the draft that only came up late.  In
   particular, it had to wait for a change in registry policy that only
   came about with the publication of TLS 1.3, which caused the draft to
   only be published after RFC 8446, and also required adding references
   to TLS 1.3.  The author also got a very late comment while in AUTH48
   that caused some rewrite.  Finally, there was some IANA issue with
   the extension registry where a similar extension was added by someone
   else.  The draft was changed to just use it.

   Changes in AUTH48 include added reference to TLS 1.3, copy-editing
   for style, some added requirements, added paragraphs, and changes in
   algorithms specification.

   extension) and UTA WG (because it has to do with applications using
   TLS).  Then the ADs determined that a new WG was needed, so the

   The specification was first submitted as a personal draft in the IPv6
   WG, then moved to the OSPF WG.  The long delay of producing this RFC
   is due to the complexity of the problem, and the need to wait for
   implementations.  It is a very important change to OSPF that makes
   OSPFv3 fully extensible.  Since it was a non-backward compatible
   change, the developers started out with some very complex migration
   scenarios but ended up with either legacy or extended OSPFv3 LSAs
   within an OSPFv3 routing domain.  The initial attempts to have a
   hybrid mode of operation with both legacy and extended LSAs also
   delayed implementation due to the complexity.

   RFC8468 was somehow special in that there was not a technical reason/
   interest that triggered it, but rather a formal requirement.  While
   writing RFC7312 the IP Performance Metrics working group (IPPM)
   realized that RFC 2330, the IP Performance Metrics Framework
   supported IPv4 only and explicitly excluded support for IPv6.
   Nevertheless, people used the metrics that were defined on top of RFC
   2330 (and, therefore, IPv4 only) for IPv6, too.  Although the IPPM WG
   agreed that the work was needed, the interest of IPPM attendees in
   progressing (and reading/reviewing) the IPv6 draft was limited.
   Resolving the IPv6 technical part was straight-forward, but
   subsequently some people asked for a broader scope (topics like
   header compression, 6lo, etc.) and it took some time to figure out
   and later on convince people that these topics are out of scope.  The
   group also had to resolve contentious topics, for example how to
   measure the processing of IPv6 extension headers, which is sometimes
   non-standard.

   The Auth48 delay for this draft was longer than average.  According
   to the authors, the main reasons include:

   o  Work-load and travel caused by busy-work-periods of all co-authors

   o  Time zone difference between co-authors and editor (at least US,
      Europe, India, not considering travel)

   o  Editor proposing and committing some unacceptable modifications
      that needed to be reverted

   o  Lengthy discussions on a new document title (required high effort
      and took a long time, in particular reaching consensus between co-
      authors and editor was time-consuming and involved the AD)

   o  Editor correctly identifying some nits (obsoleted personal
      websites of co-authors) and co-authors attempting to fix them.

   The differences between the final draft and the publish RFC show copy
   editing for style and clarity, but do not account for the back and
   forth between authors and editors mentioned by the authors.

   We examine the 20 RFC in the sample, measuring various
   characteristics such as delay and citation counts, in an attempt to
   identify patterns in the IETF processes.

4.1.  Publication delays

   We look at the distribution of delays between the submission of the
   first draft and the publication of the RFC.  We break out the total
   delay in three components:

   o  The working group delay, from the first draft to the start of the
      IETF last call;

   o  The IETF delay, which lasts from the beginning of the IETF last
      call to the approval by the IESG, including the reviews by various
      directorates;

   o  The RFC production, from approval by the IESG to publication,
      including the Auth48 reviews.

   For submissions to the independent stream, we don't have a working
   group.  We consider instead the progression of the individual draft
   until the adoption by the ISE as the equivalent of the "working
   group" period, and the delay from adoption by the ISE until
   submission to the RFC Editor as the equivalent of the IETF delay.
   The following table shows the delays for the 20 RFC in the sample:

   The average delay from first draft to publication is about 3 years,
   but this varies widely.  Excluding the independent stream
   submissions, the average delay from start to finish is 3 years and 3

   months, of which on average 2 years and 8 months are spent getting
   consensus in the working group.

   The longest delay is found for [RFC8492], 6.5 years from start to
   finish.  This is however a very special case, a draft that was
   prepared for the TLS working group and failed to reach consensus.
   After that, it was resubmitted to the ISE, and incurred atypical
   production delays.

   On average, we see that 80% of the delay is incurred in WG
   processing, 10% in IETF review, and 10% for edition and publication.
   We can compare these delays to those observed 10 years ago and 20
   years ago:

   The IETF takes three to four times more times to produce an RFC in
   2018 than it did in 1998, but about the sametime as it did in 2008.

   The increased delay does not mean increased work per RFC.  The number
   of RFC published per year remained between 200 and 300 all those
   years, and the number of participants is not greater now than in
   1998.  If we estimated the "level of attention" by dividing the
   number of participants by the number of RFC produced, we would see a
   number that remains stable.  People are probably not working much
   more on each RFC now than they were 20 years ago, but the same amount
   of work is stretched over a much longer period.

4.2.  Preparation and Publication delays

   The preparation and publication delays include three components:

   o  the delay from submission to the RFC Editor to beginning of
      Auth48, during which the document is prepared;

   o  the AUTH48 delay, during which authors review and eventually
      approve the changes proposed by the editors;

   o  the publication delay, from final agreement by authors and editors
      to actual publication.

   The breakdown of the publication delays for each RFC is shown in the
   following table.

   On average, the total delay appears to be a bit more than four month,
   but the average is skewed by the extreme values encountered for
   [RFC8492].  If we exclude that RFC from the computations, the average
   delay drops to a just a bit more than 3 months: about 2 months for
   the preparation, a bit more than one month for the Auth48 phase, and
   4 days for the publishing.

   Of course, these delays vary from RFC to RFC.  To try explain the
   causes of the delay, we compute the correlation factor between the
   observed delays and 4 plausible explanation factors:

   o  The number of pages in the document,

   o  The amount of copy edit, as discussed in (#copy-editing),

   o  Whether or not an IANA action was required.

   We find the following values:

            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Correlation | RFC edit | Auth 48 | Edit(total) |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+
            | Nb pages    |     0.50 |   -0.04 |        0.21 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | Copy-Edit   |     0.42 |    0.24 |        0.45 |
            |             |          |         |             |
            | IANA        |    -0.13 |    0.26 |        0.15 |
            +-------------+----------+---------+-------------+

   None of these indicate strong correlations.  The greater number of
   pages will tend to increase the preparation delay, but it does not
   appear to impact the Auth48 delay at all.  The amount of copy editing
   also tend to increase the the preparation delay somewhat and the
   Auth48 delay a little.  The presence or absence of IANA action has
   very ittle correlation with the delays.

   We also observe that the Auth48 delay varies much more than the
   preparation delay, with a standard deviation of 20 days for Auth48
   versus 10 days for the preparation delay.  In theory, Auth48 is just
   a final verification: the authors receive the document prepared by
   the RFC production center, and just have to give their approval, or
   maybe request a last minute correction.  The name indicates that this
   is expected to last just two days, but in average it lasts more than
   a month.

   We tested a variety of hypotheses that might explain the duration of
   AUTH48 by computing the correlation coefficients between various

   properties of the RFC and the production delays.  The results are
   listed in the following table:

       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+
       | Correlation | RFC production | Auth 48 | RFC Edit(total) |
       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+
       | Nb drafts   |           0.19 |   -0.30 |           -0.17 |
       |             |                |         |                 |
       | Nb Authors  |           0.40 |   -0.04 |            0.16 |
       |             |                |         |                 |
       | WG delay    |           0.03 |   -0.16 |           -0.15 |
       +-------------+----------------+---------+-----------------+

   The results show that there is no simple answer.  The number of
   pages, the required amount of copy editing and to a very small extent
   the number of drafts can help predict the production delay, but there
   is no obvious predictor for the Auth 48 delay.  In particular, there
   is no numerical evidence that the number of authors influences the
   Auth48 delay, or that authors who have spent a long time working on
   the document in the working group somehow spend even longer to answer
   questions during Auth48 - if anything, the numerical results point in
   the opposite direction.

   After asking the authors of the RFC in the sample why the AUTH48
   phase took a long time, and we got three explanations:

   1- Some RFC have multiple authors in multiple time zones.  This slows
   down the coordination required for approving changes.

   2- Some authors found some of the proposed changes unnecessary or
   undesirable, and asked that they be reversed.  This required long
   exchanges between authors and editors.

   3- Some authors were not giving high priority to AUTH48 responses.

   As mentioned above, we were not able to verify these hypotheses by
   looking at the data.

4.3.  Copy editing

   We can assess the amount of copy editing applied to each published
   RFC by comparing the text of the draft approved for publication and
   the text of the RFC.  We do expect differences in the "boilerplate"
   and in the IANA section, but we will also see differences due to copy
   editing.  Assessing the amount of copy editing is subjective, and we
   do it using a scale of 1 to 4:

   1- Minor editing

   2- Editing for style, such as capitalization, hyphens, that versus
   which, and expending all acronyms at least one.

   3- Editing for clarity in addition to style, such as rewriting
   ambiguous sentences and clarifying use of internal references.  For
   Yang models, that may include model corrections suggested by the
   verifier.

   4- Extensive editing.

   The following table shows that with about half of the RFC required
   editing for style, and the other half at least some editing for
   clarity.

   This method of assessment does not take into account the number of
   changes proposed by the editors and eventually rejected by the
   authors, since these changes are not present in either the final
   draft or the published RFC.  It might be possible to get an
   evaluation of these "phantom changes" from the RFC Production Center.

4.4.  Independent Series

   Out of 20 randomly selected RFC, 3 were published through the
   "independent series".  One is an independent opinion, another a
   description of a non-IETF protocol format, and the third was
   [RFC8492], which is a special case.  Apart from this special case,
   the publication delays were significantly shorter for the Independent
   Stream than for the IETF stream.  This seems to indicate that the
   Independent Series is functioning as expected.

   The authors of these 3 RFC are regular IETF contributors.  This
   observation motivated a secondary analysis of all the RFC published
   in the "independent" stream in 2018.  There are 14 such RFC: 8507,
   8494, 8493, 8492, 8483, 8479, 8433, 8409, 8374, 8369, 8367, 8351,
   8328 and 8324.  (RFC 8367 and 8369 were published on 1 April 2018.)
   We can ask whether the authors of these RFC are these outsiders, part
   of a "wider community" or are people who are also contributing to the
   IETF.  The overwhelming response is, "insiders".  Pretty much all the
   authors are or were involved in the IETF, many of them with a
   prominent track record.  There are just 2 exceptions, a single RFC in
   which only 3 of the 5 authors are well associated with the IETF.

4.5.  Citation Counts

   Part of the exercise is to test whether citation counts provide a

   The results indicate that [RFC8446] is by far the most popular of the
   20 RFC in our sample.  This is not surprising, since TLS is a key
   Internet Protocol.  Of the other publications, only 4 have 5 to 9
   citations, and the others have three or less.

   In order to get a baseline, we can look at the number of references
   for the RFC published in 2008 and 1998.  However, we need totake time
   into account.  Documents published a long time ago are expected to
   have accrued more references.  We try to address this by looking at
   three counts for each document: the overall number of references over
   the document's lifetime, the number of references obtained in the
   year following publication, and the number of references observed
   since 2018:

   The total numbers shows new documents with fewer references than the
   older ones.  This can be explained to some degree by the passage of
   time.  If we restrict the analysis to the number of references
   accrued in the year of publishing and the year after that, we still
   see higher reference counts in 1998 than in 2008 or 2018.  For
   example, the top quartile of RFC published in 1998 had at least 19
   references by the end of 1999, while the top quartile of RFC
   published in 2008 only had at least 12 references, which is twice the
   corresponding number for the RFC of 2018.

   We also see that the number of references to RFC fades over time.
   Only the most popular of the RFC produced in 1998 are still
   referenced in 2019.  The overall popularity of the RFC series benefit
   from a history of publishing relevant documents, but over time the
   references to historic documents will decrease and the overall
   popularity will depend on more recent documents.

   We need however to be a bit cautious before asserting that
   publications with a low citation count have limited impact:

   o  some documents may well accumulate more citations over time.  For
      example, [RFC8377] updates [RFC6455].  There are more than 1000
      citations of [RFC6455] on Google Scholar.  We might expect that
      the citation count of [RFC8377] will increase in the coming years.

   o  citation counts largely come from academic publications, and thus
      reflect popularity within researchers more than popularity with
      network operators and vendors.

   We should be able to assess the popularity of specifications with
   vendors, operators and designers by asking questions about deployed
   services and products.

5.  Next steps

   This draft is not really complete.  We have obtained feedback from
   many authors but not all.  We should also get a review from the RFC
   Production Center.  We may want to find a better way of looking at
   citations than simple queries on Google Scholar, and in any case we
   want to update the reference counts before publication, as they will
   keep changing over time.  When an RFC describes a protocol, we may
   want to also compare the citation counts and the deployment status of
   the protocol.

   Even with those limitations, the exercise shows some promise, and
   also shows the interest of doing more studies.

   It is tempting to go from this exercise on published RFCs to a
   broader evaluation of the IETF productivity, but this would require
   more than just evaluating the RFCs.  The IETF produces standard
   proposals and informative memos that get published in the RFC series,
   but that is not its only purpose.  Two other purposes would be the
   organization of fruitful discussions between members of the technical
   community, and the filtering of ill-thought proposals so they are not
   endorsed in IETF publications.

   We don't have good ideas yet for evaluating the propagation of ideas,
   but we could perhaps evaluate the filtering: not enough filtering
   would cause bad ideas to be published; too much filtering would cause
   good ideas to be rejected.

   Not enough filtering should be visible by analyzing the published
   RFCs.  Successful RFC will accrue many references and would drive
   many implementations.  Unsuccessful RFCs would lack both.  These
   criterias are hard to predict in advance, so we expect a fraction of
   the published RFCs to be unsuccessful.  Too small a fraction would
   indicate a process that is too conservative, too large a fraction
   would indicate a process that's too lax.  We can see that in the
   current analysis.

   On the other hand, a reasonable balance between success and lack of
   it does not guarantee that the process is very efficient.  It could
   be that the culling of bad ideas also culls good ones, and we would
   not know by just looking at the publications.  For that, we would
   need to look at publication attempts that were abandoned, for example
   drafts that expired without progressing or being replaced.  The
   sampling methodology could also be used for that purpose.  Pick maybe

   20 drafts at random, among those abandoned in a target year, and
   investigate why they were abandoned.  Was it because better solutions
   emerged in the working group?  Or maybe because the authors
   discovered a flaw in their proposal?  Or was it because some
   factional struggle blocked a good idea?  Was the idea pursued in a
   different venue?  Hopefully, someone will try this kind of
   investigation.

6.  Security considerations

   This draft does not specify any protocol.

   We might want to analyze whether security issues were discovered
   after publication of specific standards.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.

   Peliminary analysis does not indicate that IANA is causing any
   particular delay in the publication process.
