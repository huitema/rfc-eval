                  RFC Evaluation Project - First Step
                 draft-huitema-rfc-eval-project-latest

Abstract

   This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the production
   of the IETF.  We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in
   2018, looking for history and delays, and using Google Scholar as a
   proxy for the RFC popularity.  The results are interesting, and
   inform further evaluation efforts.

1.  RFC Evaluation project

   As stated on the organization's web site, "The IETF is a large open
   international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and
   researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture
   and the smooth operation of the Internet."  In this memo, we start
   exploring how the IETF could possibly be evaluated, and we do so by
   attempting to evaluate the RFC production process.

   The IETF data tracker provides information about RFC and drafts, from
   which we can infer statistics about the production system.  We can

   measure how long it takes to drive a proposition from initial draft
   to final publication, and how these delays can be split between
   Working Group discussions, IETF reviews, IESG assessment, RFC Editor
   delays and final reviews by the authors.

   Just measuring production delays may be misleading.  The IETF
   produces standard proposals and informative memos that get published
   in the RFC series, but that is not its only purpose.  Two other
   purposes would be the organization of fruitful discussions between
   members of the technical community, and the filtering of ill-thought
   proposals so they are not endorsed in IETF publications.

   To try assess this other purposes, we have to find ways to measure
   the impact of the documents that were published.  If the
   communication between participants was efficient, the documents
   should be easily accepted by the community.  If bad ideas were
   filtered, the specifications should lead to deployed product and
   services with good feedback.

   A potential failure mode of the IETF is to do too much filtering.
   After all, classifying a proposal as ill-thought or potentially
   harmful is subjective.  A comprehensive analysis would look at the
   fate of proposals that were not accepted by the IETF but got
   developed in other ways and became eventually successful.  We will
   not try to assess that in this memo, but further studies migh
   consider the issue.

2.  Methodology

   In this exploration, we want to evaluate not just the mechanics of
   the RFC production, but also the quality and impact of the results.
   This evaluation of quality and impact is subjective.  We start with
   two ideas:

   1- Use Google Scholar to assess the citation counts of published
   documents

   2- Ask the RFC authors whether the specifications resulted in the
   deployment of products or services

   Basic production mechanisms could be evaluated by processing data
   from the IETF tracker, but subjective data requires manual assessment
   of results, which can be time consuming.  Google Scholar also
   requires manual access because the site does not offer an open API.
   Since our resources are limited, we will only perform this analysis
   for a small sample of RFC, selected at random from the list of RFC
   approved in 2018.  Specifically, we will pick 10 RFC at random
   between:

   o  RFC 8307, published in January 2018, and

   o  RFC 8511, published December 2018.

   In order to avoid injecting personal bias in the random selecton, we
   use a random selection process similar to the Nomination Committee
   selection process defined in [RFC3797].  The process is seeded with
   the text string "vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas", and the results
   are:

   The average delay from first draft to publication is about 3 years,
   but this varies widely.  Excluding the independent stream
   submissions, the average delay from start to finish is 3 years and 3
   months, of which on average 2 years and 8 months are spent getting
   consensus in the working group.

   The longest delay is found for [RFC8492], 6.5 years from start to
   finish.  This is however a very special case, a draft that was
   prepared for the TLS working group and failed to reach consensus.
   After that, it was resubmitted to the ISE, and incurred atypical
   production delays.

3.2.  Independent Series

   Out of 20 randomly selected RFC, 3 were published through the
   "independent series".  One is an independent opinion, another a
   description of a non-IETF protocol format, and the third was
   [@!RFC8492], which is a special case.  Apart from this special case,
   the publication delays were significantly shorter for the Independent
   Stream than for the IETF stream.  This seems to indicate that the
   Independent Series is functioning as expected.

   The authors of these 3 RFC are regular IETF contributors.  This
   pbservation motivated a secondary analysis of all the RFC published
   in the "independent" stream in 2018.  There are 14 such RFC: 8507,
   8494, 8493, 8492, 8483, 8479, 8433, 8409, 8374, 8369, 8367, 8351,
   8328 and 8324.  (RFC 8367 and 8369 were published on 1 April 2018.)
   We can ask whether the authors of these RFC are these outsiders, part
   of a "wider community" or are people who are also contributing to the
   IETF.  The overwhelming response is, "insiders".  Pretty much all the
   authors are or were involved in the IETF, many of them with a
   prominent track record.  There are just 2 exceptions, a single RFC in
   which only 3 of the 5 authors are well associated with the IETF.

3.3.  Citation Counts

   Part of the exercise is to test whether citation counts provide a
   useful measure of the popularity of the IETF production.  These
   citation counts vary widely:

   The results indicate that [RFC8446] is by far the most popular of the
   20 RFC in our sample.  This is not surprising, since TLS is a key
   Internet Protocol.  Of the other publications, only 4 have 5 to 9
   citations, and the others have three or less.  We need however to be
   a bit cautious before asserting that publications with a low citation
   count have limited impact:

   o  some documents may well accumulate more citations over time.  For
      example, [RFC8377] updates [RFC6455].  There are more than 1000
      citations of [RFC6455] on Google Scholar.  We might expect that
      the citation count of [RFC8377] will increase in the coming years.

   o  citation counts largely come from academic publications, and thus
      reflect popularity within researchers more than popularity with
      network operators and vendors.

   We should be able to assess the popularity of specifications with
   vendors, operators and designers by asking questions about deployed
   services and products.

3.4.  Copy editing

   We can assess the amount of copy editing applied to each published
   RFC by comparing the text of the draft approved for publication and
   the text of the RFC.  We do expect differences in the "boilerplate"
   and in the IANA section, but we will also see differences due to copy
   editing.  Assessing the amount of copy editing is subjective, and we
   do it using a scale of 1 to 4:

   1- Minor editing

   2- Editing for style, such as capitalization, hyphens, that versus
   which, and expending all acronyms at least one.

   3- Editing for clarity in addition to style, such as rewriting
   ambiguous sentences and clarifying use of internal references.  For
   Yang models, that may include model corrections suggested by the
   verifier.

   4- Extensive editing.

   The following table shows that with about half of the RFC required
   editing for style, and the other half at least some editing for
   clarity.

   48 delay.

3.5.  AUTH48

   The time spent in the AUTH48 state varies widely.  In theory, this is
   just a final verification: the authors receive the document prepared
   by the RFC production center, and in theory just have to give their
   approval, or maybe request a last minute correction.  The name
   indicates that this is expected to last just two days, but in average
   it lasts more than a month.  [[TODO: ask authors of RFC 8411, 8456,
   8446, 8377, 8429, 8492 and 8468 why the AUTH48 phase took so long.]]

4.  Next steps

   The current version of this draft is very much a preliminary
   exercise.  We have yet to obtain responses from authors about
   deployments, and also explanation of delays.

   Even with those limitations, the exercise shows some promise, and
   also shows the interest of doing more studies.  For example, one of
   the plausible questions is whether the IETF impact is increasing or
   decreasing over time.  We could do that by repeating the statistical
   sampling analysis for previous years, for example 2008 and 1998.

5.  Security considerations

   This draft does not specify any protocol.

   We might want to analyze whether security issues were discovered
   after publication of specific standards.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This draft does not require any IANA action.

   Peliminary analysis does not indicate that IANA is causing any
   particular delay in the publication process.

7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

8.  Appendix: Analysis of 20 selected RFC

   We review each of the RFC listed in (#methodology), trying both to
   answer the known questions and to gather insight for further
   analyzes.

   The draft underwent very extensive copy editing, covering use of
   articles, turn of phrases, choice of vocabulary.  The changes are
   enough to cause pagination differences.  The "diff" tool marks pretty
   much every page as changed.  Some diagrams see change in protocol
   elements like message names.

   The RFC was part of cluster with [RFC8455].

Internet-Draft                  RFC-Eval                       July 2019


   This RFC has a complex history.  The first individual draft was
   submitted to the TLS working group on September 7, 2012.  It
   progressed there, and was adopted by the WG after 3 revisions.  There
   were then 8 revisions in the TLS WG, until the WG decided to not
   progress it.  The draft was parked in 2013by the WG chairs after
   failing to get consensus in WG last call.  The AD finally pulled the
   plug in 2016, and the draft was then resubmitted to the ISE.

   One year elapsed between submisson to RSE and AUTH48.  Need to ask
   why.

   Four months elapsed between AUTH48 started and done.  Need to ask the
   author why.

   Changes in AUTH48 include added reference to TLS 1.3, copey-editing
   for style, some added requirements, added paragraphs, change in
   algorithms specification,
